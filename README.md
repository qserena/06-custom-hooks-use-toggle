# Custom Hooks Use Toggle

## Description
This is an exercise in using the Toggle component to handle the state and the context of the Menu component.

The logic in the Toggle component are used to show (and hide) the dropdown menu in the Menu component.

(the yellow star has nothing to do with this challenge, it is just there as another independent Toggle implementation)
